# 🧠 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – First Semester  
**Degree:** Software Engineering  
**Semester:** 1st  
**Repository of Practices and Exams**

This repository contains the activities, practices, and exams completed during the first semester of the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. The fundamentals of OOP were covered by applying key concepts like abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, and object manipulation in the DOM, using JavaScript.

## 🧩 Topics and Practices

### 🔹 Principle of Abstraction
> I learned to identify the essential characteristics of objects and represent them through classes, focusing only on what really matters.

- `01-el-principio-de-abstraccion-malcaraz37`: Introduction to the abstraction principle, modeling basic objects using classes.
- `examen-01-el-principio-de-abstraccion-malcaraz37`: Evaluation where I applied abstraction by creating more complete class structures.
- `pr-ctica-01-el-principio-de-abstracci-n-malcaraz37`: First hands-on exercise identifying attributes and methods of an object.
- `pr-ctica-02-el-principio-de-abstracci-n-malcaraz37`: Further practice on separating essential and secondary class elements.
- `pr-ctica-03-el-principio-de-abstracci-n-malcaraz37`: Exercises creating multiple real-world object representations using abstraction.

### 🔸 Principle of Encapsulation
> I learned how to protect object data and control access using `get` and `set` methods.

- `examen-02-el-principio-de-encapsulacion-malcaraz37`: Exam where I encapsulated attributes using access methods.
- `practica-05-el-principio-de-encapsulacion-malcaraz37`: Basic implementation of setters and getters in simple classes.
- `practica-06-el-principio-de-encapsulacion-malcaraz37`: Added data validation logic within methods to ensure data safety.
- `practica-07b-el-principio-de-encapsulacion-malcaraz37`: More practice on encapsulation and its importance in protecting data.
- `practica-08-el-principio-de-encapsulacion-malcaraz37`: Working with encapsulation in more realistic and complex object structures.

---

### 🧬 Principle of Inheritance
> I learned how to reuse code by creating child classes that inherit from a parent class.

- `practica-09-el-principio-de-herencia-malcaraz37`: Exercise where a child class reuses and extends functionality from a parent class.

---

### 🖥️ DOM and Object Interaction
> I started working with the DOM to visually interact with object data through user inputs and buttons.

- `pr-ctica-10-introducci-n-a-dom-malcaraz37`: First practice using the DOM to display object information on the screen.
- `pr-ctica-11-dom-administrador-de-cursos-malcaraz37`: Developed a small system to manage courses using buttons and input fields.
- `p-ctica-11-dom-administrador-de-cursos-malcaraz37`: Alternate or improved version of the course management interface.

## 🧾 General Notes
- All activities are implemented in JavaScript.
- The focus was on understanding and applying the core principles of OOP in a hands-on and visual way.
- Classes, objects, methods, attributes, and structured coding were practiced throughout the semester.
